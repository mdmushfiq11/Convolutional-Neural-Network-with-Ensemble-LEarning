# Convolutional-Neural-Network-with-Ensemble-Learning
In this python notebook, Multivariate Time Series Classification is performed using Convolutional Neural Network with Ensemble Learning for dealing with class imbalance.
Raw Multivariate Time Series is labelled using Sliding Window after labeling each row (one minute of a multivariate time time series) as either 0 or 1
